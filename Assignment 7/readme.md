**Assignment 7**

In creating the datadbase, I included the verbage "IF NOT EXISTS" even though I knew it was a unique database because
it is a good programming practice.

I went beyond the requisite one table and coded two tables (supplier and invoices) because it would give me practice in designating a primary key, a foreign key and an index.

I opted to code the foreign key at the column-level utilizing the <REFERENCES> keyword because was clearer to me the associations between the tables. I found the <CONSTRAINT> method confusing. Should I have to code all of the tables for my
project, I will need to be able to see, at a glance, how everything is related. I'm just trying to think ahead.
  
I selected supplier_name to create an index for because I felt like it would be something commonly searched for in the database. As the primary key and foreign key are automatically given indexes, I tried to think of other fields that would be typically utilized by the user.
