Assignment 9#

Create a stored procedure that sums the freight for an undetermined Customer ID (use a parameter) and name the procedure
"customerFreightByID". Create another procedure called "test" where you call your customerFreightByID procedure three times for three
different customers. Explain how you made this a dynamic function with a parameter.
 The code is made dynamic beginning with line 24. There are no stored parameters in the second procedure. The parameters are passed 
 through upon execution. 
Create a function named "productNameLookUp" that returns a product names given the ProductID. Call your function for a ProductID of
your choice and submit as in #1 including comments.

There were no issues in drafting the code. After the amount of time I spent on #1 of this assignment, this came together very quickly.

In conclusion, working on this week's assignment was not a good experience and that's all I have to say.
