4.  Create a report that shows supplier information and the products they supply. Explain why you approached the task
    as you did
   
    I opted to include the following information in my report:
      *  Supplier ID
      *  Supplier
      *  Country
      *  Product ID
      *  Product Name
      *  Total Cost
      *  Category
   The rational behind this mix of data was that it would provide a general report to spot trends. It would, 
   at a glance, convey who the suppliers were, where they were located, the products supplied, total procurement
   costs, and the category of the supplies. The data was sorted by category, then product for further clarity 
   of the data.
   
 5.  Create a report that shows meaningful output about products that have an inventory level below 10 units. 
     Output should be sorted by UnitPrice. The report should include:
      *  Supplier Name
      *  Category Name
      *  Product Price
      *  Units In Stock
      *  Units On Order
      *  Reorder Level
      *  Product Discontinuation
     The output highlights the aggressive cost-saving measures that have been undertaken by my department. Products
     with high procurement costs have been discontinued. This is evident in the Meat/Poultry Category, affecting
     the following suppliers:
      *  G'day, Mate
      *  Pavlova, Ltd.
      *  Plutzer
     When faced with losing our business, New Orleans Cajun Delights renegotiated their condiment contract price from
     to $38 per unit down to $20 per unit. We promptly ordered 100 units of their product to take advantage of the cost
     savings.
