#**Creating a Database from a Script**

To begin, I downloaded the Northwind.sql file from our course folder and opened it in MySQL Workbench. 
To open the file, I clicked the first icon on the Editor toolbar. When the file opened and the script was loaded into the Editor window, I looked for the two relevant pieces of code. I, then, added StefReeves in place of YourName in the two instances of relevant code. 

At the top of the script, in the Comment section, I added 'Edited by Stephanie Reeves 26Jan2020'. To execute the script, I clicked the thunderbolt icon on the Editor toolbar. I saved the script, using the Save icon on the Editor toolbar. Once I refreshed the Schemas window and confirmed that my personalized database appeared, I took a screenshot of my screen.

Finally, I uploaded my script file and screenshot to my GitHub folder for this assignment.
